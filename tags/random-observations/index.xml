      <description>While I was reading about the Translation operator today, I stumbled upon the wiki for Emmy Noether - famous for &amp;ldquo;Noether&amp;rsquo;s theorem&amp;rdquo; which tells us that conservation laws follow from the symmetry properties of nature. It was interesting to note that she had worked at a German institute for seven years without pay because at that time(~1910), women were largely excluded from academic positions. This was comforting to me because I was feeling sad about the fact that I only started learning CS after I started my undergrad.</description>
