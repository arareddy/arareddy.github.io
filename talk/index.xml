      <title>Space Bounded Complexity classes and Derandomization</title>
      <link>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20191203/</link>

      <description>In this talk, we will give an introduction to Space Bounded Complexity classes and give an overview of $BPL \subseteq \text{SPACE}(\log^2 n)$ result by Nisan. For space bounded complexity classes, we will follow the lecture notes by Prof. Luca Trevisan and for the $BPL \subseteq \text{SPACE}(\log^2 n)$ result, we will follow the lecture notes by Prof. Jonathan Katz.</description>

      <title>Markov Chains and Random Walks on Networks</title>
      <link>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20190531/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20190531/</guid>
      <description>The talk included 2 parts: A general introduction to Finite Markov Chains, and an introduction to Random walks on Networks(with their connection to electrical networks). The content for the talk was mostly from Chapters 1, 2, and 8 of the book Markov Chains and Mixing Times by David Levin and Yuval Peres.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20190522/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20190522/</guid>
      <description>The content for the talk was mostly taken from one of Arora et.al&amp;rsquo;s blog posts on offconvex.org and their paper A Theoretical Analysis of Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning. The first time I came across this paper was through a plenary talk given by Sanjeev Arora at ALT 2019.</description>

      <title>Bilu-Linial Stable instances of Graph Partioniong problems</title>
      <link>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20190214/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://aravindreddy.org/talk/20190214/</guid>
      <description>The content for the talk was mostly taken from the SODA&amp;rsquo;14 paper titled Bilu-Linial Stable Instances of Max Cut and Minimum Multiway Cut by Makarychev, Makarychev, and Vijayaraghavan. The presentation style and some of the examples were inspired by Tim Roughgarden&amp;rsquo;s lecture on the same topic.</description>
