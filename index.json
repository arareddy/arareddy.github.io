Prior to joining the Broad, I graduated from Northwestern with a PhD in Computer Science. At NU, I was in the CS theory group and was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Konstantin Makarychev and Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan. A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I spent four wonderful years at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur as a spirited undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and minoring in Physics.\nMy research is broadly in the theoretical foundations of machine learning. More specifically, I have worked on projects related to Causal Inference, Clustering, Determinantal Point Processes, Graphical Models, and Submodular Function Optimization. More recently, I have been interested in Computational Biology, which is the research area I will majorly be working while at the Broad.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://aravindreddy.org/author/aravind-reddy/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/aravind-reddy/","section":"authors","summary":"I recently joined as a postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where my primary mentor is Dr. Victoria Popic.
